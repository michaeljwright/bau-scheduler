# bau-scheduler

BAU Scheduler is a tool for all engineers within a company to take it in turns to support the business for half a day at a time.

All our engineers (10 of them) are loaded into a pool and selected at random to do half a day's support shift over a two week period. The amount of shifts each engineer does within the two week period can be changed and the shift timeslots can be validated to make sure an engineer does not do a shift in consecutive days or on the same day.

The shifts are then loaded into a calendar which are shown over the two week period. The views can be switched from list to calendar month and are designed to be responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile.
